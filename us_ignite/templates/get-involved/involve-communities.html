<p>Whether in the commercial, social or government sectors, technology has the power to spur innovation, engage citizens, leverage untapped assets, create efficiencies and change lives.  To that end, US Ignite is a convener of stakeholders that have a vested interest in working together to stimulate the research, development, and promotion of next-generation networks and applications to transform sectors of national priority such as education, healthcare, workforce development, energy, public safety, advanced manufacturing and transportation.  Our intent is to complement, support, and facilitate relationships among key stakeholders providing opportunities to magnify their impact and transform sectors of national priority.

      <p>In the early twentieth century, many families whose homes were being connected to the electric grid wanted only light bulbs, because light was all they knew electricity could “do.” There was little, if any, awareness that electricity would ultimately power almost all the “applications” around us – fundamentally changing every single experience we have in our homes, businesses, and lives.</p>

      <p>The same kind of transformation will be powered by the gigabit Internet, and it’s shortsighted for journalists and policy-makers to focus on Internet speeds alone. It leads Americans to think “Gigabit Internet equals faster movie downloads.” This is why initiatives like US Ignite and projects that foster the <strong>next-generation of applications</strong> and services are so critical.
      </p>

      <p>Through working with communities like Chattanooga,TN Kansas City, Burlington, VT, Red Wing, MN and Flint, MI we’ve developed the following roadmap to success:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Form a leadership group</li>
        <li>Identify assets in your community (e.g. resource universities, incubators, fiber, etc)</li>
        <li>Adopt or develop applications that solve local problems and provide public benefit</li>
        <li>Coordinate best-practice sharing among local and national participants</li>
        <li>Leverage US Ignite resources and national partnerships</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="subheader">Building a Network</h3>

      <p>Is your community grappling with bringing advanced networking infrastructure into reality? US Ignite helps coordinate network testbeds, but does not build networks. </p>

      <p>None the less, here are some resources that might be able to assist:</p>
