<h2 class="header">GET INVOLVED - COMMUNITIES - LEARN</h2>

      <p>In the early twentieth century, many families whose homes were being connected to the electric grid wanted only light bulbs, because light was all they knew electricity could “do.” There was little, if any, awareness that electricity would ultimately power almost all the “applications” around us – fundamentally changing every single experience we have in our homes, businesses, and lives.</p>

      <p>The same kind of transformation will be powered by the gigabit Internet, and it’s shortsighted for journalists and policy-makers to focus on Internet speeds alone. It leads Americans to think “Gigabit Internet equals faster movie downloads.” This is why initiatives like US Ignite and projects that foster the <strong>next-generation of applications</strong> and services are so critical.
      </p>

      <p>Through working with communities like Chattanooga,TN Kansas City, Burlington, VT, Red Wing, MN and Flint, MI we’ve developed the following roadmap to success:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Form a leadership group</li>
        <li>Identify assets in your community (e.g. resource universities, incubators, fiber, etc)</li>
        <li>Adopt or develop applications that solve local problems and provide public benefit</li>
        <li>Coordinate best-practice sharing among local and national participants</li>
        <li>Leverage US Ignite resources and national partnerships</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="subheader">Building a Network</h3>

      <p>Is your community grappling with bringing advanced networking infrastructure into reality? US Ignite helps coordinate network testbeds, but does not build networks. </p>

      <p>None the less, here are some resources that might be able to assist:</p>
