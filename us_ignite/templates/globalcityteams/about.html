         	The Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) is a collaborative network of project teams, or “action clusters,” working on innovative applications of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies within a smart city / smart community environment. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and US Ignite have teamed-up with the Department of Transportation (DoT), National Science Foundation (NSF), International Trade Administration (ITA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Energy (DoE) to create the Global City Teams Challenge to advance practical applications of the latest research in cyberphysical systems.

                 <span class="bold">Why participate in a Global City Team “Action Cluster”?</span><br>
The Challenge is an opportunity for forward-looking communities to partner with public and private organizations to accelerate the deployment of IoT technologies designed to address some of the most pressing challenges facing cities. The Challenge also benefits innovative companies and non-profits by giving them a chance to implement and/or assess their solutions in valuable municipal testbeds, and provides them with exposure to scores of potential new customers.

            <p class="bold">How does the Global City Teams Challenge Work?</p>
            <p>
"Action clusters," composed of representatives of innovative local governments, non-profits and private companies will form through NIST and US Ignite events and the US Ignite website. These teams volunteer to work collaboratively to build, deploy or test transformative, yet specific IoT applications. The Global City Teams Challenge builds upon the success of NIST’s 2013-2014 SmartAmerica initiative in which more than 100 organizations participated forming 24 teams.
